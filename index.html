    <p> I am studying cyber security and I hope to work for either the military or the government.</p>
    <p> I love reading books and watching movies. As a hobby I'm learning how to make video games. </p>
    <p> I like learning different types of programming so I'm interested in learning how to websites because I will most likely will have to defend one.</p>
    <p> I have been a member my entire life; I was baptised in 2010. My favorite scripture is the entire chapter of Isaiah 53.</p>
